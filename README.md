###### Hyderabadi biryani

**Hyderabadi biryani** is one of the India's most popular types of biryani. It incorporates goat meat or chicken that is marinated and cooked along with the long grained rice and is seasoned with coconut, saffron and selected spices.
I love this dish because of it's **taste** and **aroma**.
